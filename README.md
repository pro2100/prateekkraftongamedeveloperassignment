The TCP socket at server end constantly listens for client connections on port 65432. It uses threading to handle multiple clients concurrently, assigning each a unique UUID upon connection. A 200ms time.sleep(LAG) is used to simulate network latency within each client's handler thread. When a client sends its updated position (JSON), the server processes it. It checks for collisions between the client and a shared coin_state. If a collision occurs, the player's score is updated, and the coin is randomly respawned. Finally, the server broadcasts the comprehensive game state (all players, coin position, and scores) to all currently connected clients, the lag is treated so to experiance a smooth motion at the client end by interpolate_state function which makes the moves gradually at the leap rate of 0.25 between the final and initial position values from the server.
